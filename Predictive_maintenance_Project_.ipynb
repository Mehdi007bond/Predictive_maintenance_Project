The objective is to anticipate equipment failures early by learning degradation patterns from multivariate sensor time series (temperature, vibration, current, torque). The dataset simulates 4 production lines and 12 machines over 60 days, with a state-based failure label (â‰ˆ4% positive).\n\n","## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose\n","- Anticipate failures with sufficient lead time (â‰ˆ58 hours) to plan maintenance.\n","- Reduce unplanned downtime and optimize maintenance schedules.\n","- Provide a reproducible baseline (data generation + LSTM modeling) ready for industrial adaptation.\n\n","## ðŸ§  Method Overview\n","1. Generate realistic sensor signals with machine-specific degradation profiles.\n","2. EDA to understand distributions, correlations, and failure patterns.\n","3. Sequence modeling (LSTM) with temporal windows to classify failing states.\n","4. Evaluate with AUROC/AUPRC/F1 and per-segment analysis (line/type).\n\n","## ðŸ“¦ Stack\n","Python, pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn, TensorFlow/Keras (LSTM).\n"]},
